files for managing monicahq in k8s with argocd

this is just for playing around with minikube and argocd. note that I stripped out the volumes, so all of the data is lost every time these containers are rebuilt

the main monica project can be found here https://github.com/monicahq/monica

I built this environment by hand in minikube using these docker instructions and then backed into the yaml files once it got it up and running
