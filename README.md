files for deploying and managing monicahq in k8s with ArgoCD

this is just for playing around with minikube and ArgoCD. Note that I stripped out the volumes, so all of the data is lost every time these containers are rebuilt

The main monica project can be found here https://github.com/monicahq/monica

I built this environment by hand in minikube using these docker instructions and then backed into the k8s yaml files once it got it up and running

Also note that on my old laptop (Thinkpad T420, 16GB RAM), it takes 7 full minutes after deployment with ArgoCD before the login screen appears
